TO-DO-LIST project is a very good for learning javascript

<h4>language of page is FARSI(persian)</h4>

ui of this webpage is designed by bootstrap

in this program we can add some tasks and make a list of them also after we finish any task we can remove it from list

we can search a specific task in our list (dont want search the task correctly. if the letter you entered includes a task , the task show to you)

also in this program use localStorage for set the information on the storage of browser. that means if you reloading the program the task you already added is exist yet. when you remove a task it removes from local storage
